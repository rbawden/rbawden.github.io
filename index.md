I am a researcher in the
[ALMAnaCH project-team](https://almanach.inria.fr/index-en.html) at
[Inria](https://inria.fr/en) Paris, France. I am a specialist of
Machine Translation (MT), having worked on contextual MT during my PhD
at the LIMSI laboratory (now LISN) and MT for low-resource languages in my post-doc at the University of Edinburgh. I am currently working on a range of topics in MT and multilingual NLP, focusing mainly on language variation, both for historical and contemporary texts (for example user-generated content, dialectal variation), evaluation and resource creation. I am currently a fellow in the [PR[AI]RIE-PSAI research institution](https://www.prairie-psai.fr).
