  - title: "TraLaLaM (Translating with Large Language Models)"
    dates: "2023–2026"
    description: "The aim of the project is to explore the use of large language models (LLMs) for machine translation, by asking two main questions: (i) in what scenarios can contextual information be effectively used via prompting? and (ii) for low-resource scenarios (with a focus on dialects and regional languages), can LLMs be effectively trained without any parallel data?"

  - title: "MaTOS (Machine Translation for Open Science)"
    dates: "2023–2026"
    description: "The aim of the project is to develop new methods for the machine translation (MT) of complete scientific documents, as well as automatic metrics to evaluate the quality of these translations. Our main application target is the translation of scientific articles between French and English, where linguistic resources can be exploited to obtain more reliable translations, both for publication purposes and for gisting and text mining."

    dates: "2022–2023"
    description: "The aim of this project is to investigate domain adaptation for neural machine translation. We will be exploring the adaptation of models to specific, low-resource domains domains as well as training models for multiple domains."
